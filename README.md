# IPPT Tracker

Created a full stack application to track IPPT Trainings using TypeScript, React and Express.
Thought of this random idea as I had to start training for my IPPT and I thought it would be nice
to keep track of my trainings to see my progress.
Instead of creating a tracker for the own user, I created features to allow users to follow friends
so that they can check out each other's progress too. Something similar to Twitter, but for a more specific use case.
Also have a branch to get started with a sample project with all the authentications features set up.
