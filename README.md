# IPPT Tracker

Created a full stack application to track IPPT Trainings using TypeScript, React and Express.
Thought of this random idea as I had to start training for my IPPT and I thought it would be nice
to keep track of my trainings to see my progress.
Instead of creating a tracker for the own user, I created features to allow users to follow friends
so that they can check out each other's progress too. Something similar to Twitter, but for a more specific use case.
Also have a branch to get started with a sample project with all the authentications features set up.

## What I've learnt from this

- TypeScript > Javascript anytime, anyday...
- How to authenticate using JWT tokens, on both the frontend and backend
- NestJS is nicer than Express since it give nicer structure
- Plan properly first before deciding if I really need to use Redux for something. Not everything needs to use the Redux store.

## How to view

- clone the repo
- go to the server folder and run `npm install`
- go to the client folder and run `npm install`
- in the server dir, run `npm run start`
- in the client dir, run `npm start`
